# Password Security & Authentication Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains **Task 4** of the Cybersecurity Internship, focused on analyzing
password security, hashing mechanisms, password attack techniques, and modern
authentication practices. The task aims to provide practical understanding of how
weak passwords are compromised and how strong authentication improves security.

---

## Objectives
- Understand how passwords are stored using hashing
- Identify different password hash algorithms
- Analyze weak and strong passwords
- Study common password attack techniques
- Learn the importance of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Provide recommendations for secure authentication

---

## Concepts Covered
- Hashing vs Encryption  
- Password Hash Algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, bcrypt, Argon2id)  
- Password Hash Generation  
- Dictionary Attack and Brute Force Attack  
- Weak Password Analysis  
- Strong Password Characteristics  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

---

## Tools & Resources Used
- Online Hash Generators (MD5, SHA-1)
- Online Hash Identifier Tools
- Self-research and documentation
- Screenshot-based demonstrations 

---

## Files Included
- **Password_Security_Task4_Report.pdf** – Detailed analysis report  
- **hashes_examples.txt** – Sample passwords and their hashes  
- **screenshots/** – Screenshots showing hash generation and identification 

---

## Key Observations
- Common passwords such as `123456` and `password123` are weak and easily cracked
- Hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 are outdated and insecure
- Strong passwords use sufficient length, randomness, and multiple character types
- Modern algorithms such as bcrypt and Argon2id provide better protection
- Multi-Factor Authentication significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access

---

## Conclusion
Password security plays a critical role in protecting user accounts and systems.
Weak passwords are vulnerable to dictionary and brute-force attacks, while strong
passwords combined with secure hashing algorithms and Multi-Factor Authentication
offer effective defense against cyber threats. Implementing proper password policies
is essential for modern cybersecurity systems.

## Final Outcome
Through this task, practical knowledge was gained on password attacks, defenses,
and secure authentication methods, strengthening the understanding of real-world
cybersecurity practices.
